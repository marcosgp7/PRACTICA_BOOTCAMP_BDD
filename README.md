# PRACTICA_BOOTCAMP_BDD
This is a repository for database work using dbt and snowflake.

The work is divided into 6 parts. Each part needs the resolution of the previous one to continue.

## _PART A_

First do a DATASET study to understand the information provided by each table. 
There is NO need to document this study unless it is deemed necessary to justify the logic being applied.

You will work with the Snowflake test dataset TCPH_SF1.

## _PART B_

RAW data layer

Creates a "RAW" data layer that is a subset obtained from the DATASET simulating a "fake" data generation. 
A company like this, which delivers shipments, will periodically receive orders in its database.
